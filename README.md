# 🐍 Python Projects for Beginners

This repository contains **beginner-friendly Python projects** created for learning and practice purposes.  
Each project focuses on core Python concepts and is written in a clear and simple way so others can follow along.

This is an **ongoing repository**, and more projects will be added over time as I continue learning Python.

## 📌 Projects Included

### 1. To-Do List (Command Line)
A simple command-line application that allows users to:
- Add tasks
- View all tasks
- Delete tasks
- Save tasks to a file so data is not lost after closing the program

**Concepts practiced:**
- Lists
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- File handling (read/write)
- Basic user input

---

### 2. Calculator (Command Line)
A text-based calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

The program allows users to perform multiple calculations in one run and handles invalid input gracefully.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Functions
- User input handling
- Type conversion (`int`, `float`)
- Exception handling (`try / except`)
- Control flow (`while`, `match-case`)

---

### 3. Countdown Timer
A simple countdown timer where the user enters a time in seconds, and the program displays the remaining time in:
- Hours
- Minutes
- Seconds

The timer updates every second until it reaches zero.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Loops
- Time calculations
- Formatting output
- Using built-in modules (`time`)

---

### 4. Text Encryption & Decryption
A basic encryption and decryption program that:
- Encrypts user input using a shuffled character key
- Decrypts encrypted text back to its original form

This project demonstrates a simple substitution cipher concept.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Strings and lists
- Index-based mapping
- Randomization
- Using built-in modules (`random`, `string`)
- Basic cryptography concepts

---
